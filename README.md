## Installation

To use this mod you must fist have a copy of Portal 2 downloaded on your steam library.

1. Download the files from this repository 
2. Place the contents in a folder named `Portal2Archipelago` in your steam `sourcemods` folder. On windows this may be found at
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods`
The folder structure should look like this
```
sourcemods
|   
└─── Portal2Archipelago
     |  GameInfo.txt
     |   ...
     └─── cfg
     └─── ...
```
3. Go to steam and you should see the mod in your steam library. Run it as you would a normal steam game. If it doesn't show up simply restart steam (closing the app completely not just the steam window) and it should appear
4. Open the settings for the mod by right clicking the mod in your steam library and select `Properties...`. Then in the launch options box add `-netconport 3000`. This allows the Client to speak to the game which is essential for using the mod.
